Nice 🚀 your **personal portfolio website** deserves a really professional README since it represents *you* directly (and rtCamp will surely check it).
Since it’s built using **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**, I’ll highlight that along with deployment on **Vercel**.

Here’s the complete README for your repo:

For the **short description (GitHub tagline)**, you can use:  

**“Personal portfolio website built with the MERN stack, showcasing skills, projects, and achievements.”**  

Do you want me to also make a **section that lists your startups (Badri Quantech, Saarthon.ai, etc.)** in the portfolio README to highlight your entrepreneurial side?
